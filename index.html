        <p class="section-two__desc">
          I am a passionate and detail-oriented Web Developer with a solid
          foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I enjoy crafting
          clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites that provide a smooth
          and engaging user experience. With hands-on experience in developing
          modern web interfaces, I aim to deliver high-quality code and
          intuitive designs. I am familiar with version control systems like Git
          and have worked with tools such as VS Code and browser developer tools
          to enhance my workflow. I actively keep myself updated with the latest
          trends and technologies in frontend development to ensure my work is
          aligned with current industry standards. I thrive in collaborative
          environments and value teamwork, effective communication, and
          continuous learning. My goal is to contribute meaningfully to
          development projects while growing my skills and advancing my career
          as a Web Developer.
